# Lane Detection on FPGA-HW/SW part with SDSoC
Realization of Advance Lane Detection Algorithm on Xilinx ZYNQ-7000 using SDSoC platform. <br />

This project realized in C++ using with OpenCV and xfOpenCV Libraries. <br />
It is a sub-task of "REALIZATION OF LANE DETECTION ALGORITHMS ON FPGA USING SDSOC AND VIVADO" graduate project at Istanbul Technical University, June 2018. <br />
